1. IF you want to use local browser than it can be done in 2 ways
     i. Use extension (FoxyProxy- https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-basic/ )
    ii. Go to browser settings & search "Network Settings"
   than click on Manual proxy to put the proxy you need to go to burp proxy settings and copy that address and tick mark the use of proxy for https.    
2. if i manually change proxy multiple times and dont fix it properly than it will create browser problems so its best to use extension.
3. So after installing extension go to FoxyProxy settings , go to proxies tab and than click Add where give title,port and hostname(127.0.0.1) that proxy you got from burp.
